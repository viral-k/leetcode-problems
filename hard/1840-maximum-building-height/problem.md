# Maximum Building Height

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**LeetCode Link:** [Maximum Building Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-building-height/)

## Description

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building must be `0`.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed `1`.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must have a height less than or equal to `maxHeighti`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in `restrictions`, and building `1` will not be in `restrictions`.

Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Heights [0,1,2,1,2]. The tallest building has height 2.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
Output: 5
Explanation: Heights [0,1,2,3,4,5]. The tallest building has height 5.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3]. The tallest building has height 5.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^9`
- `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 10^5)`
- `2 <= idi <= n`
- `idi` is unique.
- `0 <= maxHeighti <= 10^9`
