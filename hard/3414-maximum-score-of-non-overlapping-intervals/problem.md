# Maximum Score of Non-overlapping Intervals

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**LeetCode Link:** [Maximum Score of Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-non-overlapping-intervals/)

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [l_i, r_i, weight_i]`. Interval `i` starts at position `l_i` and ends at `r_i`, and has a weight of `weight_i`. You can choose up to 4 non-overlapping intervals. The score of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most 4 indices from `intervals` with maximum score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.

Two intervals are said to be non-overlapping if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: Intervals 2 and 3 have weights 5 and 3.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: intervals = [[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]
Output: [1,3,5,6]
Explanation: Intervals 1, 3, 5, and 6 have weights 7, 6, 3, and 5.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 3`
- `intervals[i] = [l_i, r_i, weight_i]`
- `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9`
- `1 <= weight_i <= 10^9`
