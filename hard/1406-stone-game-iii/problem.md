# Stone Game III

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**LeetCode Link:** [Stone Game III](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii/)

## Description

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take `1`, `2`, or `3` stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is `0` initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return `"Alice"` if Alice will win, `"Bob"` if Bob will win, or `"Tie"` if they will end with the same score.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: "Bob"
```

### Example 2
```
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: "Alice"
```

### Example 3
```
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]
Output: "Tie"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000`
