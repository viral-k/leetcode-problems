# Path Existence Queries in a Graph II

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**LeetCode Link:** [Path Existence Queries in a Graph II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-ii/)

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `maxDiff`.

An undirected edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `maxDiff` (i.e., `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]`, find the minimum distance between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. If no path exists between the two nodes, return `-1` for that query.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i`th query.

Note: The edges between the nodes are unweighted.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 5, nums = [1,8,3,4,2], maxDiff = 3, queries = [[0,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,1]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 5, nums = [5,3,1,9,10], maxDiff = 2, queries = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[4,3]]
Output: [1,2,-1,1]
```

### Example 3
```
Input: n = 3, nums = [3,6,1], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: [0,-1,-1]
Explanation: No edges exist; only the self-query returns 0.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= maxDiff <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i] == [u_i, v_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
