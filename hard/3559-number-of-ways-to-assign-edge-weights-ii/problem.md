# Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**LeetCode Link:** [Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-assign-edge-weights-ii/)

## Description

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, rooted at node `1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of `0`. You must assign each edge a weight of either `1` or `2`.

The cost of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui, vi]`, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the path such that the cost of the path between `ui` and `vi` is odd.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply modulo `10^9 + 7` to each `answer[i]`.

**Note:** For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node `ui` and `vi`.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation:
Query [1,1]: path has no edges, cost 0 -> 0 valid assignments.
Query [1,2]: path has one edge -> weight 1 is odd -> 1 valid assignment.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]
Output: [2,1,4]
Explanation:
Query [1,4]: 2 edges -> 2 odd-cost assignments.
Query [3,4]: 1 edge  -> 1 odd-cost assignment.
Query [2,5]: 3 edges -> 4 odd-cost assignments.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `edges` represents a valid tree.
