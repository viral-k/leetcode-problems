**Difficulty:** Easy  
**LeetCode Link:** [Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/)

## Description

Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return the number of strings in `patterns` that exist as a substring in `word`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
```

### Example 2
```
Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" and "b" appear as substrings; "c" does not.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= patterns.length <= 100`
- `1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= word.length <= 100`
- `patterns[i]` and `word` consist of lowercase English letters.
