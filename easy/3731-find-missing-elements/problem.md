**Difficulty:** Easy  
**LeetCode Link:** [Find Missing Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-elements/)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of unique integers.

Originally, `nums` contained every integer within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone missing from the array.

The smallest and largest integers of the original range are still present in `nums`.

Return a sorted list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an empty list.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Range [1..5]; only 3 is missing.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]
Output: []
Explanation: Range [6..9]; nothing missing.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [5,1]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: Range [1..5]; 2, 3, 4 are missing.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
