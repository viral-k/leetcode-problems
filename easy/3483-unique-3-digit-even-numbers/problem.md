**Difficulty:** Easy  
**LeetCode Link:** [Unique 3-Digit Even Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-3-digit-even-numbers/)

## Description

You are given an array of digits called `digits`. Your task is to determine the number of distinct three-digit even numbers that can be formed using these digits.

Note: Each copy of a digit can only be used once per number, and there may not be leading zeros.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: digits = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: The 12 distinct 3-digit even numbers are 124, 132, 134, 142, 214, 234,
312, 314, 324, 342, 412, and 432. Note that 222 cannot be formed because there is
only 1 copy of the digit 2.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: digits = [0,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 202 and 220 can be formed. The digit 2 may be used twice because
it appears twice in the array.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: digits = [6,6,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 666 can be formed.
```

### Example 4
```
Input: digits = [1,3,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: No even 3-digit numbers can be formed.
```

## Constraints

- `3 <= digits.length <= 10`
- `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`
