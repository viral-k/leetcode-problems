# Concatenate Non-Zero Digits and Multiply by Sum II

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**LeetCode Link:** [Concatenate Non-Zero Digits and Multiply by Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenate-non-zero-digits-and-multiply-by-sum-ii/)

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `m` consisting of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]`.

For each `queries[i]`, extract the substring `s[l_i..r_i]`. Then, perform the following:

- Form a new integer `x` by concatenating all the non-zero digits from the substring in their original order. If there are no non-zero digits, `x = 0`.
- Let `sum` be the sum of digits in `x`. The answer is `x * sum`.

Return an array of integers `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

Since the answers may be very large, return them modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: s = "10203004", queries = [[0,7],[1,3],[4,6]]
Output: [12340, 4, 9]
Explanation:
s[0..7]="10203004" -> x=1234, sum=10 -> 12340
s[1..3]="020" -> x=2, sum=2 -> 4
s[4..6]="300" -> x=3, sum=3 -> 9
```

### Example 2
```
Input: s = "1000", queries = [[0,3],[1,1]]
Output: [1, 0]
```

### Example 3
```
Input: s = "9876543210", queries = [[0,9]]
Output: [444444137]
Explanation: x=987654321, sum=45, product=44444444445 mod (10^9+7) = 444444137.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= m == s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of digits only.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]`
- `0 <= l_i <= r_i < m`
