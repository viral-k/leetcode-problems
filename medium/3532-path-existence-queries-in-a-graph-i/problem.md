# Path Existence Queries in a Graph I

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**LeetCode Link:** [Path Existence Queries in a Graph I](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-i/)

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `maxDiff`.

An undirected edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `maxDiff` (i.e., `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]`, determine whether there exists a path between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if there exists a path between `u_i` and `v_i` in the `i`th query and `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 2, nums = [1,3], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: [true,false]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 4, nums = [2,5,6,8], maxDiff = 2, queries = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [false,false,true,true]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `0 <= maxDiff <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i] == [u_i, v_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
