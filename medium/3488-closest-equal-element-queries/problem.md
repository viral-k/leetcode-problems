# Closest Equal Element Queries

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**LeetCode Link:** [Closest Equal Element Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-equal-element-queries/)

## Description

You are given a **circular** array `nums` and an array `queries`.

For each query `i`, you have to find the following:

- The **minimum distance** between the element at index `queries[i]` and any other index `j` in the circular array, where `nums[j] == nums[queries[i]]`.
- If no such index exists, the answer for that query should be `-1`.

Return an array `answer` of the same size as `queries`, where `answer[i]` represents the result for query `i`.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,3,1,4,1,3,2], queries = [0,3,5]
Output: [2,-1,3]
Explanation:
- Query 0: nums[0] = 1. Nearest same value at index 2, distance = 2.
- Query 1: nums[3] = 4. No other index has value 4, result = -1.
- Query 2: nums[5] = 3. Nearest same value at index 1, circular distance = 3.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [0,1,2,3]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: Each value in nums is unique, so no index shares the same value.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= queries.length <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `0 <= queries[i] < nums.length`
